# DBACO-workflow

The experiment of scalability is in "EvaluateRuntime.java", and it requires more workflow examples.

Please download the DAX workflow archive before running this java file from https://download.pegasus.isi.edu/misc/SyntheticWorkflows.tar.gz, unzip it and keep the DAX workflows in an appropriate position. Or, you can just use some workflow samples which have been already included in this project.

For each case, please set Evaluate.WORKFLOW_LOCATION to the directory where the workflows are stored before running the experiments.
